### **Day 1: From Technologist to Builder**

#### ☀️ Morning Session: **The Technologist — Mastering the Core "Why"**

* Master the foundational "why" behind modern AI with a deep, intuitive grasp of Machine Learning and Transformer architectures, equipping you to engage confidently with engineering teams and lead with credibility.
* **Go "Under the Hood"**: Gain a clear understanding of core Machine Learning concepts and delve into the architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Transformers.
* **Understand the Engine**: Explore their training methods, including pre-training and fine-tuning and examine the fundamental strengths and limitations of cutting-edge LLMs.
* **Translate Theory to Practice**: Apply your knowledge through a hands-on, no-code ML model.

#### 🌤️ Afternoon Session: **The Builder — From Idea to Interactive Prototype**

* This hands-on stage is dedicated to mastering the tools that allow you to rapidly prototype, validate ideas, and create tangible AI-powered experiences yourself.
* **Master the Art of Control**: Learn professional-level skill in prompt engineering to steer AI models and go beyond simple prompts by designing and building your first functional AI Agent capable of executing complex tasks.
* **Build Your First AI Products**: Use AI playgrounds to build and ship multiple prompt-based micro-products and custom GPTs.

#### 🍸 Evening:

* Networking over dinner and drinks with Investors, Product and Business Leaders from your cohort and broader community.

#### ✅ **Day 1 Outcomes**

* Clearly explain the core technology of LLMs to any audience, from engineers to executives.
* Lead technical discussions with confidence and credibility, eliminating any sense of being an imposter in AI meetings.
* Demonstrate professional-level skill in prompt engineering to effectively interact with and control generative models.
* Build multiple functional products and custom GPTs that you can ship using only prompts.
* Build and deploy your own functional AI agent, giving you a real-world project for your portfolio.

### **Day 2: From Architect to Product Leader**

#### 🌅 Morning Session: **The Architect — Designing Production-Ready Systems**

* A great prototype doesn't automatically make a great product. As an architect, you will learn to design systems that are robust, defensible, and built upon a coherent data strategy and repeatable patterns.
* **Develop Your Data Strategy**: Build an actionable plan for integrating GenAI that accounts for crucial factors like cost-value tradeoffs and data privacy. Learn to identify and mitigate common LLM flaws like hallucinations, biases, and lack of grounding.
* **Build a Defensible Moat with Data**: Master Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect your product to external data and understand when to use Finetuning to improve model performance.
* **Advanced System Design**: Understand advanced concepts like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) systems to architect more sophisticated solutions.

#### ☀️ Afternoon Session: **The Product Leader — Driving Product Success & Organizational Change**

* Your impact expands from a single product to the entire organization. You will learn to navigate the complexities of shipping AI, and lead the strategic integration of this technology across your company.
* **Analyze Real-World Use Cases**: Identify lessons learned and best practices of successful GenAI and agentic AI implementations. Discover a wide range of applications and use cases for GenAI and agentic AI across various industries and domains.
* **Build a Long-Term GenAI Strategy**: Develop a strategic framework to identify high-potential use cases and evaluate organizational considerations, including team structure, required for successfully implementing GenAI solutions.
* **Master the Shipping & Validation Process**: Learn the end-to-end process for taking a product from a Proof-of-Concept (POC), to MVP, to full deployment and validation in the market.
* **Future Readiness**: Explore the potential impact of AGI on products, industries, and society and their difference from narrow AI systems. Stay informed about AGI research trends and breakthroughs.

#### ✅ **Day 2 Outcomes**

* Develop a strategic framework for integrating GenAI into your products.
* Deploy strategies to mitigate weaknesses in AI models, such as hallucinations and potential biases.
* Create bulletproof GenAI roadmaps that get funded because you know exactly which tool to use and why.
* Pinpoint high-potential use cases and accurately assess the business value of bringing a new AI feature to market.
* Confidently lead your company through the technological shift, securing your relevance and becoming the leader your company needs you to be.
